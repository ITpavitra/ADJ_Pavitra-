Step 1: Create index.jsp – Input Form Page This page contains a form with a text box to collect the user's name.

Step 2: Create welcome.jsp – Greeting Page This page reads the name, stores it in the session, and displays a greeting. It also sets the session timeout to 1 minute.

Step 3: Deploy and Test Run the application on a server like Apache Tomcat. Steps to test: Go to index.jsp. Enter your name and submit. You'll see the greeting. Wait for more than 1 minute without interacting. Refresh the page — you’ll get a message that the session has expired.
